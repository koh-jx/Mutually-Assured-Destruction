- Add gravity towards center of a circle 
	- Gravity pull formula in unity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6n-8jp-ZAY
	- also refer to 3247 lab2 to see whatever i did with those cars (think those just hard codes the location away from orbit directly though)
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy-LcFZTTZU does it PER character, but i want to do it using only 1 Gravity handler node
	- Use of collision box and collision layer/mask?


- Add "gravity area" to planet to affect all objects in the area
	- All objects colliding with this area are pulled towards the center and have their rotation updated based on gravity pull direction
- Add circular motion of an entity along the sphere (i.e left/right motion accounting for rotation of entity)
- Add tank entities with stats (health, move speed, reload time)
- Add projectile motion missles affected by gravity shot at fixed angle from player
- Change fixed angle to a range
- Add health
- Add UI/sprites
- 2 player implementation + controls
- Single-player + AI?
- Add more weapons (drill, carpet bombing, explosion on impact)

- Add nuke gauge, which powers up spells as you shoot/get damaged, and decreases over time

- Add power ups (superspeed, infinite ammo)

- Add multiple planets?
- 2 player via networking?
